<p class="blurb">After successfully leading the police to a notorious crook--okay, so she almost got herself killed--Rachel Sanders is hot on the trail of another mystery: Why did Deb Wiley, their newspaper carrier, drive her car into a small pond? And how could she possibly drown? The pond isn't that deep.

    <p class="blurb">Hubby Brian is onboard with Rachel's snooping now; he enjoys investigating bad folks almost as much as he enjoys the good sex that comes with the chase. And this time around, it isn't just the adrenaline rush that cranks up his motor. One of the people they interview owns an adult store. (The sex toys are intriguing even if they can't afford them.)</p>
    
    <p class="blurb">As these two troll for clues, they manage to hook a big fish: a politician running for the US Senate. The phrase "beware of people in high places" never made more sense now that Brian and Rachel are on the case.</p>
    
    <p class="blurb">Read about Rachel and Brian's first adventure in <u>Up To No Good</u>.</p>
<br>
<p class="review"><em>"In this sequel to <u>Up To No Good</u>, Marsha Cornelius brings back her wacky crime-solving husband and wife team of Rachel and Brian Sanders. These characters, in addition to being extremely likable, are also among the most realistic fictional sleuths I've encountered."</em></p><br>
<p class="review"><em>" . . . Satisfies on all levels - a great story, well-plotted, characters you care about (and bad guys you root against), with a bit of marital romance thrown in for good measure. Nothing feels contrived or forced - the reader can easily see her- or himself in similar situations."</em></p><br>
<p class="review"><em>"Rachel and Brian are a couple you will look forward to visiting and each new adventure is like catching up with old friends. Their relationship and dialogue is so realistic, and just a little snarky, that you'll wish you could sit and chat with them over a nice glass of wine. (They) even manage to "learn the ropes" about BDSM."</em></p><br>

<h3>H10N1</h3><p>In the aftermath of a deadly flu pandemic, there is no protection from looters scavenging everything from guns to canned peas. When Dr. Taeya Sanchez is fired from a medical facility, she decides to steal the hospital’s armored van. Unfortunately, Rick DeAngelo has already stocked the van for his own getaway. These two must pick their way across the wasteland of America searching for a safe haven. As the miles roll by, they discover that the living should be feared more than the festering corpses out there.</p><a class="buyBtn" href="https://www.amazon.com/H10N1-M-R-Cornelius-ebook/dp/B005H3ESEO/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Purchase</a>

It’s a long shot. His frozen body will be stored in liquid nitrogen for the next 75 years, and then he’ll wake up in the future. Maybe. If technology figures out a way to bring him back. Once frozen, Robert realizes his soul is very much awake, and free to move about, just like the others who were frozen before him. He can ride in a cockpit with the pilots, but can’t turn the page of a book. He can’t work, or eat, or sleep. These obstacles make it tough to fall in love, and impossible to reconcile with the living.</p><a class="buyBtn" href="https://www.amazon.com/Losing-All-Marsha-Cornelius-ebook/dp/B00BRKN25M/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Purchase</a></div>[/one_half_last]

<h3>LOSING IT ALL</h3><p>Frank is content living on the streets of Atlanta. A soup kitchen and a makeshift shanty sure beat his days as a POW in Vietnam. But Chloe can’t handle the eviction that sends her into the hell of homelessness. She and her children are sucked into the traumatic world of night shelters, and dangerous predators.
When they bump into each other at the soup kitchen, Frank offers Chloe a glimmer of hope that she can pull her life back together. She rekindles his lost sense of self-worth. But they will not meet again until Frank is riding high as a working man, and Chloe has hit rock bottom.</p><a class="buyBtn" href="https://www.amazon.com/Losing-All-Marsha-Cornelius-ebook/dp/B00BRKN25M/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Purchase</a>

<h3>HABITS KICK BACK</h3><p>Prescription drugs are so common in the future they’re called supplements, and dispensed at meals like side dishes. Just like everyone else, Luna takes pills to curb her appetite, increase her memory, focus her concentration, improve her mood, even suppress her sex drive.
Now in college, she’s beginning to wonder what life is like outside this drug-induced state. Once she stops taking the supplements, she discovers food tastes delicious, her friend Sal is suddenly sexy, and the search for a valuable lost medallion turns into a real adventure.
Hopefully, all her new habits don’t get her killed.</p><a class="buyBtn" href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Kick-Back-Marsha-Cornelius-ebook/dp/B00LILUUT6/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Purchase</a>

<h3>A TALE OF MORAL CORRUPTION</h3><p>In the future, women rule and men know their place. 28 year-old Mason can’t wait to be a loving father and supportive husband. He’s especially looking forward to wearing the new artificial womb that so many men have strapped on their bellies. First, however, he must be chosen from the Approved Partner Registry, a website that profiles men and their qualifications. It’s used by businesswomen who don’t have the time or inclination to date.
In the meantime, he works hard at his clerical job with a large corporation, and volunteers at the company’s co-op daycare. He keeps his body in good physical condition. He even took a remedial course with a sex surrogate when the registry listed him as a premature ejaculator. His diligence will pay off when he is selected as a mate.
But when he is dropped from the Approved Partner Registry, his life begins to unravel and it doesn’t look like anything can stop his fall from grace.</p><a class="buyBtn" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tale-Moral-Corruption-Marsha-Cornelius-ebook/dp/B018YNIUU6/ref=pd_sbs_351_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=SY1F8KHRG9JTQ1GGET8C" target="_blank">Purchase</a>

Brian says she's a snoop.Lately, her nosy nature has escalated. She's gotten it into her head that a house down the road might be used to make adult films. Her clues?

She’s determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, but if her snooping keeps uncovering unexpected dirt, it may be the last thing she ever does.</p><a class="buyBtn" href="https://www.amazon.com/Up-No-Good-Marsha-Cornelius-ebook/dp/B01N1RNHIR/ref=pd_sbs_351_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=PQJQ6E25GSCRXSPQ8CGD" target="_blank">Purchase</a>
